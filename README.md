# Python Projects Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains my personal Python projects. These projects cover a wide range of topics and are a demonstration of my skills and interests in Python programming.

## Projects

The projects in this repository include:

1. Password Generator: 
This Python program is designed to generate a random password based on user inputs. The user can specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. The program then generates a password that meets these criteria.

In the easy version of this program, the password is generated in sequence. For example, if the user wants 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 3 numbers, the password might look like `fgdx$*924`, where all the letters, symbols, and numbers are grouped together. Each time a password is generated, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different, adding an extra layer of randomness to the password generation process.

This program is a great way to create secure, random passwords that can be used for various online accounts. It demonstrates the use of Python lists and loops, and is a fun and practical application of Python programming.

2. Hangman Game :



This is a Python-based implementation of the classic game, Hangman. The game selects a random word from a list and the player's goal is to guess the word, one letter at a time. The player starts with 6 lives and loses a life for each incorrect guess. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word before running out of lives, or loses all their lives without guessing the word. The repository contains the main game script (`hangman.py`), a list of possible words (`hangman_words.py`), and ASCII art for the hangman and game logo (`hangman_art.py`). This game is a fun and interactive way to test your vocabulary and guessing skills. Enjoy playing!

... and more to come!

## Installation and Setup

Most of these projects are standalone Python scripts. To run these projects, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website.

To run a project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run.
3. Run the Python script using the command: `python script_name.py`
